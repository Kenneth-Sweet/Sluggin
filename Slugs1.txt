Web 3.0 unleashed ravages not seen since Adobe Shockwave.

The first victims were as always those no one cared for. 
Furries were slaughtered first their craving for Photoshop work to be directly streamed into their conciousness while the edits were flying in from there over worked 
depravity exposed artists sought little remorse. The pained artists stepped up to the plate and pleaded the case for them. For the case for Furries was truly the case for their own livelihood. These pained artists in the final hour were betrayed not for the rationally irrational hatred of Furries, but their own kin who fell for promises of better work. Of more meaningful exhibits to yet belong to them. Exhibits that only took place in their dreams.

The subsequent groups to follow in demise were not so lofty in stature for a while. Soundcloud rappers were cut from their nectar and cast down into more physical forms of medium. There inability to clamor away from an incessant 512kbps AAC encodings began the true freying of the ethernet cords the Furries took blame for. Few mourned their abscense.

The hated knights only called on to last resort due to their unbearable stench and boundless anger. Could stand in defiance of the crumbling.
